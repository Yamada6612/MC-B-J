# MC-B-J 

This project aims to make it easy to install the necessary resources to create a Minecraft server both Java and bedrock note that if you want to play different versions just change the .jar files (the current java version is 1.16.5 and the bedrock version is 1.19.0)

requirements: 2gb of ram a quad-core processor and 2 or 3gb of free memory 

I don't recommend using the server and playing at the same time on the same device for obvious reasons

 have a good time.

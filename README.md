This project aims to make it easy to install the necessary resources on termux to create a Minecraft server on android for both Java and bedrock note that if you want to play different versions just change the .jar files (this script it's totally compatible with the latest version of Minecraft )

minimum requirements: 2gb of ram a quad-core processor and 2 or 3gb of free memory 

# installation:
copy the command 
 ``` 
 git clone https://github.com/Yamada6612/MC-B-J  
 ```
 after cloning the repository or have downloaded use the command
 ```
  sh MC-B-J/setup.sh
 ```
this script will install the necessary files and configure the command to facilitate activation, the command is MC

I don't recommend using the server and playing at the same time on the same device for obvious reasons

 have a good time.
